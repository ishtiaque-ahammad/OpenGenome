# OpenGenome
OpenGenome is an easy-to-use multi-assembler platform for doing genome assembly. 
The user simply have to provide the name of the raw sequencing files and which assembler he or she wants to use! 
OpenGenome will perform quality control, genome assembly, removal of unassembled contigs and will provide a brief summary of the assembled genome (length of the genome, number of contigs, minimum and maximum length of the contigs, n50, n75, n90 values etc). 
After installing OpenGenome, simply type "OpenGenome" in the terminal and hit enter. 
It will ask for the raw sequencing file names, which assembler you want to use (megahit / spades / unicycler) and the number of cpu cores you want to use. 
Once OpenGenome is done, the output files will be available in the OpenGenome_Output folder.
